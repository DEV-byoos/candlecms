            NNGA stands for Neural-Network Genetics-Algorithms. Basically NNGA is a simple backpropagation neural network.
            Since the backpropagation itself would need a lot of time, Some engineers use Genetics Algorithm to optimize it.
            You can see how this works (I need a week to make this module :D).
